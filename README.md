### Kotlin compatibility

A new version of Kotlin may be not supported immediately after its release. But after some time we will release a
version of Compose Multiplatform
that supports it.
Starting from 1.2.0, Compose Multiplatform supports multiple versions of Kotlin.

| Kotlin version | Minimal Compose version | Notes                                               |

| 1.8.20         | 1.4.0                   |                                                     |
